# Heart-Disease-Detection-using-ML

This project predicts whether a person is likely to have heart disease or not, based on medical parameters using **Logistic Regression**. It's an AI/ML project built in Python with added visualizations using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**.

---

## 📊 Dataset

- The dataset used is `data.csv`, containing patient health-related data like:
  - Age, Sex, Chest Pain Type
  - Cholesterol, Fasting Blood Sugar
  - Resting ECG, Heart Rate, Exercise Induced Angina
  - ST Depression, Slope, Number of Major Vessels, Thal
- The target column indicates whether heart disease is present (`1`) or not (`0`).

## 📚 Acknowledgement

This project is inspired by tutorials from [GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/) and the YouTube video [Heart Disease Detection Project](https://youtu.be/F_9gGyCs3YY?si=bOAX_kk548IgneNr).  
Special thanks to the original creators for their guidance.

I have enhanced the project by:
- Adding custom visualizations using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**
- Improving user flow for input prediction
- Polishing the notebook structure and formatting for better understanding
